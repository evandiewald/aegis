# Aegis

[Aegis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis) is an LLM-powered tool for solving real-world Github issues. I use [SWE-Bench](https://www.swebench.com) for evaluation.

This is a side project that I'm using as a learning opportunity to get hands-on with applications of agents for software engineering. It is significantly inspired by [Moatless Tools](https://github.com/aorwall/moatless-tools), whose incredibly helpful code & experiments have helped me overcome a number of technical challenges. I'm hoping to use this as a jumping-off point for more novel experiments.

To accelerate development, I leveraged [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) for orchestration of the agentic workflows.
